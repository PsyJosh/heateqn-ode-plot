# Heat Equation ODE Solver
The goal is to solve a representation of heat along a rod represented by the equation

$\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + \frac{2}{q+x} \frac{du}{dx} - \frac{2p}{q+x}u = 0; u(0) = 0, u(1) = 1$.

This page includes files used to solve the differential equation given in the Jupyter Notebook. The files include my written solution, a blank practice version, and my .py script including all functions. 
The notebooks have a more detailed introduction on the equation and the solving process.
